## Tenant-to-Tenant Migration Planning

### The Challenge

Microsoft 365 tenant-to-tenant migrations are among the most complex IT projects organizations undertake. Whether driven by mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or organizational restructuring, these migrations touch every user and every piece of data.

Traditional approaches rely on spreadsheets, manual discovery, and fragmented tooling—leading to:

- Incomplete understanding of what needs to migrate
- Missed dependencies between users, groups, and content
- Poor stakeholder communication
- Extended project timelines and budget overruns

### The Novalysis Approach

Novalysis provides a single platform for planning and coordinating your migration:

**Discovery**
Automatically build a complete inventory of your source tenant. Users, groups, Teams, SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, and Exchange mailboxes—all captured and continuously synchronized.

**Analysis**
AI-powered agents help analyze your data, identify risks, and prioritize migration waves based on actual usage patterns and dependencies.

**Planning**
Organize your migration into tasks, assign owners, set schedules, and track progress. Link tasks to specific resources and stakeholder communications.

**Communication**
Keep users informed with integrated communications management. AI-assisted drafting helps create clear, consistent messaging for different audiences.

**Validation**
Verify destination tenant readiness before migration. Check for naming conflicts, validate URLs, and confirm account availability.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot Readiness

### Preparing for AI in Your Organization

Microsoft 365 Copilot is transforming how people work—but deploying Copilot successfully requires understanding your data landscape.

### Common Copilot Readiness Concerns

**Oversharing Risk**
Copilot can surface content that users have access to but may not be aware of. Understanding your permission landscape is critical before enabling Copilot.

**Data Quality**
Copilot works best with well-organized, current content. Identifying stale or redundant content improves Copilot effectiveness.

**Sensitive Content**
Some content shouldn't be surfaced by Copilot. Understanding where sensitive data lives helps configure appropriate protections.

### How Novalysis Helps

**Permission Analysis**
Understand who has access to what across your SharePoint and OneDrive estate. Identify overly permissive sharing before Copilot makes it visible.

**Content Discovery**
Map your content landscape. Identify high-value content, stale data, and areas that need attention before Copilot deployment.

**Usage Patterns**
Understand how content is actually being used. Focus cleanup and organization efforts on high-impact areas.

**Risk Assessment**
AI-powered risk analysis identifies potential issues and suggests remediation strategies specific to Copilot deployment.

## Use Cases

### Mergers & Acquisitions

When organizations come together, so do their Microsoft 365 tenants. Novalysis helps plan the consolidation:

- Map both source and destination tenants
- Identify naming conflicts and duplicates
- Plan migration waves by department or location
- Coordinate stakeholder communications across organizations

### Divestitures

Spinning off a business unit requires extracting users and content cleanly:

- Identify all resources associated with the divested unit
- Plan data separation and migration
- Ensure complete extraction without leaving orphaned content
- Verify destination tenant setup

### Tenant Consolidation

Organizations with multiple tenants from past acquisitions often consolidate:

- Assess multiple source tenants simultaneously
- Identify opportunities for consolidation and cleanup
- Plan phased migration across tenants
- Maintain visibility across the entire program

### Copilot Pilot Preparation

Before enabling Copilot for pilot groups:

- Assess permission health for pilot users
- Identify sensitive content exposure risks
- Recommend cleanup priorities
- Monitor readiness metrics
