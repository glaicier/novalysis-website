## Migration Decision Tracking

### Every Object, Every Decision, Fully Audited

Moving to a new Microsoft 365 tenant is like moving house—removal agents often just pack everything and move it without knowing how things fit in your old or new home, whether they'll still fit, or whether you even want to keep them.

Novalysis takes a different approach. We analyse your data and provide insights and suggestions about what should and shouldn't be migrated, enabling organisations to make informed decisions with full accountability.

**Complete Object Tracking**
Every user account, mailbox, SharePoint site, Team, and group in your tenant gets tracked individually. Each object can be marked with a migration decision:

- **In Scope** — Approved for migration
- **Out of Scope** — Not being migrated (with reason documented)
- **Blocked** — Cannot be migrated due to technical constraints
- **Pending Review** — Awaiting decision

**Full Audit Trail**
No more Excel files that are hard to control and audit, or wondering why an account or SharePoint site was not moved. Every decision is tracked:

- Who made the decision
- When it was made
- The reason or justification
- Any notes or context

**Post-Migration Reporting**
After migration, Novalysis provides a complete extract showing exactly what was migrated and why, including account mappings between source and destination tenants.

## Comprehensive M365 Discovery

### Automated Tenant Sync
Connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant and let Novalysis build a complete picture of your environment. Our intelligent sync engine uses Microsoft Graph API with delta queries to maintain an up-to-date view while minimizing API calls.

- **Users & Groups**: Import all users, security groups, and distribution lists
- **SharePoint Sites**: Discover all site collections, subsites, and content
- **OneDrive Accounts**: Track personal storage across your organization
- **Teams**: Map all Teams, channels, and membership
- **Exchange Mailboxes**: Capture mailbox metadata and configuration

## Task Management

### Migration Planning Workspace
Organize your migration into manageable tasks with our built-in task management system.

- Create tasks for departments, sites, or user groups
- Track progress with status indicators (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- Assign owners and due dates
- Link tasks to specific resources and communications
- Filter and search across your task portfolio

### Scheduling & Milestones
Map your migration timeline with scheduled tasks and key milestones. Visualize dependencies and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

## AI Agents

### Four Specialized Agents
Novalysis includes four AI agents powered by Azure OpenAI, each with a specific role in your migration planning:

**Data Analyst Agent**
Evaluates data patterns across your M365 estate. Identifies heavily-used resources, inactive content, and helps prioritize migration waves based on actual usage patterns.

**Communications Agent**
Transforms technical migration requirements into user-friendly communications. Creates announcement templates, FAQ responses, and stakeholder updates tailored to different audiences.

**Architect Agent**
Provides technical recommendations for complex scenarios. Helps design migration approaches for challenging configurations like nested Teams, complex SharePoint permissions, or hybrid environments.

**Risk Analyst Agent**
Identifies potential issues before they become problems. Analyses your environment for migration blockers, data sensitivity concerns, and suggests mitigation strategies.

## Communications Management

### Adoption and Change Management (ACM) Support
Successful migrations aren't just technical projects—they're people projects. Users need to understand what's changing, why it matters, and what they need to do. Novalysis provides comprehensive ACM capabilities built directly into the migration planning workflow.

**Structured Communication Planning**
Plan your change management alongside your technical migration:

- Create communication schedules aligned with migration waves
- Define target audiences (all users, specific departments, VIPs, IT champions)
- Track which groups have received which communications and when
- Link communications directly to migration tasks for complete traceability

**AI-Powered Writing Assistant**
Creating clear migration communications is challenging—technical teams understand the requirements, but translating them into language that everyday users can follow is another matter. Our writing assistant:

- Transforms technical requirements into plain-language guidance
- Ensures users understand exactly what is being asked of them
- Adapts tone and detail level for different audiences (executives, IT staff, end users)
- Suggests improvements to reduce confusion and support queries
- Maintains consistency across all migration communications

**Stakeholder-Specific Messaging**
Different stakeholders need different information. Executives want high-level progress and risk summaries. IT champions need technical details. End users just want to know what to do and when. Novalysis helps you craft targeted messages for each audience from the same underlying migration data.

**Measuring Communication Effectiveness**
Track engagement with your communications:

- See which communications have been viewed
- Identify users who may have missed critical updates
- Follow up with targeted reminders

### Migration Hub for Users
The site acts as a central migration hub where users can see all communications sent to them—whether organisation-wide announcements or individual notifications. This reduces instances where users lose track of emails or forget what stage they're at in the migration process.

- View all migration communications in one place
- See both org-wide and individual messages
- Track personal migration status and next steps
- Access relevant resources and guidance
- Never miss an action item buried in email

## FAQ & AI Assistant

### Knowledge Base with AI Integration
Build a migration FAQ that answers common questions before they're asked. But Novalysis goes further with AI assistant integration that provides personalised responses.

**AI-Powered Q&A**
Users can ask questions about the migration in natural language:

- "What do I need to do before the migration?"
- "When is my mailbox being moved?"
- "Why am I seeing a warning about my account?"

The AI assistant provides responses tailored to their specific account. For example, it can inform a user that their mailbox exceeds the size limit and explain what actions they need to take, rather than giving generic guidance.

**Personalised Context**
Responses are aware of the user's:
- Current migration status
- Account-specific issues or blockers
- Upcoming actions required
- Historical communications received

## Migration Tool Integration

### Works With Your Existing Tools
Novalysis complements your existing migration tooling rather than replacing it. We integrate with industry-standard migration tools through flexible exports.

**Quest Integration**
Export migration snapshots in Quest-compatible format, including:
- Full tenant inventory
- Migration status for every object (in scope, out of scope, blocked)
- Account mappings and metadata

**ShareGate Integration**
Generate ShareGate-ready exports with:
- Site collections and migration decisions
- User mappings between tenants
- Permission and configuration data

**Snapshot Exports**
At any point, export a complete snapshot of your tenant's migration state for use in your migration tooling or for record-keeping.

## Destination Verification

### Pre-Migration Validation
Before you migrate, verify your destination tenant is ready:

- Check user account availability
- Validate group naming conventions
- Confirm SharePoint URL availability
- Identify potential conflicts before they cause issues

---

## Reporting & Analytics

### SharePoint Activity Tracking
Understand how SharePoint sites are actually being used with activity tracking:

- Site visit patterns and trends
- Last accessed dates for prioritization
- Usage analytics for cleanup decisions
- Export data for further analysis

### Executive Dashboards
High-level views for stakeholder reporting:

- Migration progress at a glance
- Task completion metrics
- Risk and issue summaries
- Timeline adherence tracking
