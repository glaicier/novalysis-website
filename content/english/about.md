## Our Mission

We believe Microsoft 365 migrations don't have to be painful. Organizations deserve tools that give them complete visibility into their environments, help them plan with confidence, and keep stakeholders informed throughout the journey.

Novalysis was built by practitioners who have lived through the challenges of enterprise M365 migrations—and wanted a better way.

## Why We Built Novalysis

### The Problem

Traditional migration planning relies on a patchwork of tools:

- **Discovery scripts** that produce static spreadsheets
- **Project management tools** disconnected from actual data
- **Communication platforms** that don't link to migration tasks
- **Third-party SaaS tools** that require sending sensitive data off-premises

This fragmentation creates gaps—resources get missed, stakeholders lose visibility, and projects run over time and budget.

### Our Solution

Novalysis brings everything together in one platform:

- **Live discovery** that stays current as your environment changes
- **Integrated task management** linked to actual resources
- **AI-powered analysis** that surfaces insights and risks
- **Communications management** connected to your migration plan
- **Security-first architecture** that keeps your data in your control

## Our Approach

### Security First

We believe security shouldn't be an afterthought. That's why Novalysis deploys as an Azure Managed Application in your own subscription. Your tenant data never leaves your environment.

### AI-Assisted, Human-Led

Our AI agents augment your team's capabilities—they don't replace human judgment. Agents help analyze data, draft communications, and identify risks, but you remain in control of decisions.

### Built for Enterprise

Novalysis is designed for organizations with real complexity. Multiple domains, nested Teams, complex SharePoint hierarchies, regulatory requirements—we've built for these realities.
